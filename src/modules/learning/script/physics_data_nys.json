      "C": "392 J",
      "D": "400 J"
    },
    "correctAnswer": "D",
    "explanation": "Work done against gravity is calculated as force multiplied by vertical height: W = mgh = 20 kg * 9.8 m/s^2 * 2 m = 400 J.",

      "C": "20 m/s",
      "D": "25 m/s"
    },
    "correctAnswer": "B",
    "explanation": "The final velocity can be calculated using the equation: v = u + at, where v is the final velocity, u is the initial velocity (0 m/s in this case), a is the acceleration (F/m), and t is the time. Substituting the values gives v = 0 + (3000/1500) * 5 = 15 m/s.",
